/*
  Button

  Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital
  pin 13, when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 2.


  The circuit:
   LED attached from pin 13 to ground
   pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
   10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground

   Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
  attached to pin 13.

// variables will change:
int lastbuttonState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status
int ledState = 0;

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
